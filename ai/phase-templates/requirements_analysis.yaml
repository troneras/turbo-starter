      TASK: Analyze Specification Document
      
      OBJECTIVES:
      1. Extract functional requirements from specification
      2. Identify non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
      3. Map requirements to existing system components
      4. Flag potential architectural impacts
      
      DELIVERABLES:
      - Requirements breakdown in shared context
      - Architectural impact assessment
      - Risk factors and unknowns identified
      
      UPDATE SHARED CONTEXT WITH:
      - requirement_list: [List of functional requirements]
      - nonfunctional_requirements: [Performance, security, etc.]
      - architectural_impact: [Components that will be affected]
      - risk_factors: [Potential issues or unknowns]

      TASK: Assess Domain Complexity
      
      OBJECTIVES:
      1. Determine if specialized domain knowledge is needed
      2. Identify which domain experts should be involved
      3. Assess complexity level for planning purposes
      
      DECISION LOGIC:
      - IF touches authentication → spawn auth-specialist
      - IF involves payments → spawn payment-specialist  
      - IF complex business logic → spawn domain-specialists
      
      UPDATE SHARED CONTEXT WITH:
      - complexity_level: [low|medium|high]
      - required_specialists: [List of domain experts needed]
      - domain_risks: [Domain-specific risks identified]
