# Feature Implementation Workflow - Shared Context
**Workflow**: feature-implementation  
**Started**: 2025-07-29  
**Specification**: Edition-Based Release System Implementation  

## Project Context
- **Repository**: CMS Platform (TypeScript monorepo with TurboRepo)
- **Architecture**: Fastify API + React Admin UI + shared contracts + PostgreSQL
- **Current Status**: Existing multi-tenant CMS with RBAC, requires release management system

## Specification Summary
Implementing an edition-based release and rollback system that enables:
- Git-like branching with multiple parallel releases
- Atomic deployments and instant rollbacks  
- Universal entity system with version management
- Preview functionality and conflict detection
- Full audit trail and RBAC integration

## Key Requirements from Spec
1. **Performance**: Sub-second deploy/rollback, fast canonical view queries
2. **Scalability**: Support 50+ concurrent releases, 10K+ entities per release
3. **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing multi-tenant architecture
4. **Safety**: Atomic operations, conflict detection, comprehensive audit trail

## Architecture Impact Assessment
- **Database**: New tables (releases, entities, entity_versions, relation_versions)
- **API**: New release management endpoints + release-aware middleware
- **Frontend**: Release context provider + management UI components
- **Contracts**: New TypeBox schemas for release operations

## Workflow Phases Status
- [ ] Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
- [ ] Phase 2: Solution Design
