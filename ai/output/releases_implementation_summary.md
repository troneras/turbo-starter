# Release System Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the core backend infrastructure for an edition-based release and rollback system for the CMS platform. This enables Git-like branching, atomic deployments, and instant rollbacks.

## What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Database Schema & Migration ✅

1. **Release Management Tables** (`packages/db/schema/releases.ts`)
   - `releases` table with status tracking (OPEN, CLOSED, DEPLOYED, ROLLED_BACK)
   - Deploy sequence for monotonic ordering
   - Full audit trail with createdBy/deployedBy tracking

2. **Entity System Tables** (`packages/db/schema/entities.ts`)
   - `entities` table for universal content objects
   - `entity_versions` table for immutable content snapshots
   - `relation_versions` table for many-to-many relationships
   - Support for all content types (brands, translations, pages, etc.)

3. **Canonical Views** (`packages/db/migrations/0002_create_release_views.sql`)
   - `v_entities` - Release-aware content view
   - `v_brands`, `v_translations`, `v_pages`, `v_components` - Type-specific views
   - `v_relations` - Active relationship view
   - Helper functions: `set_active_release()`, `get_active_release()`

### Phase 2: Shared Contracts ✅

1. **TypeBox Schemas** (`packages/contracts/schemas/releases.ts`)
   - Complete schema definitions for releases, entity versions, and diffs
   - Request/response schemas for all API operations
   - Full OpenAPI documentation support

2. **TypeScript Types** (`packages/contracts/types/releases.ts`)
   - Comprehensive type definitions with TSDoc documentation
   - Type exports for frontend consumption
   - Examples for all major types

### Phase 3: API Layer ✅

1. **Release Repository Plugin** (`apps/api/src/plugins/app/releases/releases-repository.ts`)
   - Full CRUD operations for releases
   - Deploy and rollback functionality
   - Content copying when creating based on existing release
   - Diff preview between releases

2. **Release Context Middleware** (`apps/api/src/plugins/app/releases/release-context.ts`)
   - Automatic release detection from headers/query params
   - PostgreSQL session variable management
   - Preview permission checking
   - Response headers indicating active release

3. **API Routes** (`apps/api/src/routes/api/releases/index.ts`)
   - GET `/api/releases` - List releases with filtering
   - GET `/api/releases/:id` - Get release details
   - POST `/api/releases` - Create new release
   - PATCH `/api/releases/:id` - Update release metadata
   - POST `/api/releases/:id/deploy` - Deploy release
   - POST `/api/releases/rollback` - Rollback to previous release
   - POST `/api/releases/diff` - Preview differences
   - GET `/api/releases/active` - Get current active release

4. **RBAC Permissions** (`packages/db/migrations/0003_add_release_permissions.sql`)
   - Granular permissions: create, read, update, close, deploy, rollback, delete, preview, diff
   - Role assignments:
     - Admin: All permissions
     - Editor: Create, read, update, close, preview, diff
     - User: Read, diff only
     - Service: Read only

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Release Lifecycle Management
- Create releases with optional base release (copy content)
- Update metadata for OPEN/CLOSED releases
- Deploy CLOSED releases atomically
- Instant rollback to any previous release

### 2. Content Versioning
- Every content change creates immutable version
- Support for CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- Change tracking with reason and change sets
- Full audit trail with user attribution

### 3. Release Context
- Automatic release context per request
- Session-based PostgreSQL variable for queries
- Preview mode for non-deployed releases
- Permission-based access control

### 4. Diff and Preview
- Compare any two releases
- Field-level difference tracking
- Filter by entity types or brands
- Summary statistics (added/modified/deleted)

## Database Migrations Applied

1. `0001_flippant_spirit.sql` - Core tables and indexes
2. `0002_create_release_views.sql` - Canonical views and functions
3. `0003_add_release_permissions.sql` - RBAC permissions

## API Security

- JWT authentication required for all endpoints
- Role-based access control
- Confirmation tokens for destructive operations
- Preview mode restricted to editors/admins

## Next Steps (Not Implemented)

### Phase 4: Frontend Integration
- Release context provider for React
- Release switcher component
- Release management UI pages

### Phase 5: Testing
- Database layer unit tests
- API integration tests
- Frontend component tests

### Phase 6: Advanced Features
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Scheduled deployments
- Release templates
- Bulk content operations

## Usage Example

```bash
# Create a new release
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/releases \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Summer Campaign 2025", "description": "Q3 content updates"}'

# Deploy a release
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/releases/42/deploy \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"confirmationToken": "DEPLOY-CONFIRMED"}'

# Preview with specific release
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/brands \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-CMS-Release: 42"
```

## Technical Decisions

1. **Bigint for IDs** - Future-proof for large-scale deployments
2. **JSONB Payload** - Flexible content storage without schema changes
3. **Session Variables** - Efficient release context without query modification
4. **Immutable Versions** - Never update, always insert for full audit trail
5. **Deploy Sequence** - Monotonic ordering for reliable rollback

## Integration Points

- Works with existing RBAC system
- Compatible with current multi-tenant architecture
- Maintains existing API patterns and conventions
- TypeScript end-to-end type safety preserved

The backend implementation is complete and ready for frontend integration. All core functionality for release management, deployment, and rollback is operational.
