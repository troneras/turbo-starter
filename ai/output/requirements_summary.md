# Frontend-Backend Auth Integration - Requirements Analysis

## Executive Summary

This requirements analysis examines the integration of the existing MSAL frontend authentication with the backend user management system. The current state shows frontend authentication is working but lacks backend integration for user creation, role management, and admin functionality.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Authentication Integration
1. **Automatic User Creation**: When a user successfully authenticates via MSAL, create user record in backend database if not exists
2. **Admin Role Assignment**: First 10 users created should automatically receive 'admin' role, subsequent users get 'user' role  
3. **User Session Management**: Update last login timestamp and Azure AD identifiers (oid/tid) on each login
4. **Token Exchange**: Frontend MSAL token should be exchanged for backend JWT containing user info, roles, and permissions

### User Management UI
1. **User List View**: Display paginated list of all users with search and filtering capabilities
   - Show: Name, Email, Roles, Last Login, Status (active/inactive)
   - Support filtering by role and status
   - Include bulk selection for actions
2. **Role Management**: Allow admins to assign/remove roles from users
   - Available roles: admin, editor, translator, viewer
   - Multiple role assignment support
   - Real-time role description display
3. **User Status Management**: Toggle user active/inactive status
4. **Bulk Operations**: Support bulk role assignment and deactivation

### API Endpoints Enhancement  
1. **User List Endpoint**: Enhance existing `/api/users` with search, filtering, and bulk operations
2. **Role Assignment Endpoint**: Create dedicated endpoint for role management operations
3. **User Status Endpoint**: Add endpoints for activating/deactivating users
4. **Audit Trail**: Track who made changes to user roles and when

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Security Requirements
1. **Access Control**: Only users with 'admin' role can access user management features
2. **Self-Protection**: Users cannot modify their own roles or deactivate themselves
3. **Token Security**: Ensure proper JWT validation and secure token exchange
4. **Audit Logging**: All user management actions must be logged with actor identification

### Performance Requirements  
1. **Response Time**: User list should load within 2 seconds for up to 1000 users
2. **Pagination**: Support efficient pagination for large user sets
3. **Search Performance**: User search should complete within 500ms
4. **Bulk Operations**: Bulk actions should handle up to 100 users efficiently

### Usability Requirements
1. **Progressive Enhancement**: UI should work without JavaScript for basic functionality
2. **Mobile Responsive**: User management interface must work on tablet devices
3. **Accessibility**: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for screen readers and keyboard navigation
4. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for failed operations with retry options

### Reliability Requirements
1. **Data Consistency**: Role assignments must be atomic and consistent
2. **Idempotency**: Bulk operations should be idempotent and recoverable
3. **Fallback Behavior**: System should degrade gracefully if Azure AD is unavailable
4. **Transaction Safety**: Database operations must be wrapped in transactions

## Architectural Impact

### Frontend Components Affected
1. **New Components Required**:
   - `/src/features/users/pages/users-list-page.tsx` - Main user management interface
   - `/src/features/users/components/user-table.tsx` - User data display component  
   - `/src/features/users/components/role-assignment-modal.tsx` - Role editing interface
   - `/src/features/users/components/bulk-actions-toolbar.tsx` - Bulk operations UI
   - `/src/features/users/hooks/use-users.ts` - User data management hooks

2. **Modified Components**:
   - Navigation/sidebar - Add user management menu item for admins
   - Role-based routing - Extend existing auth guards for user management
   - API client - Add user management API calls

### Backend Components Affected  
1. **Enhanced Plugins**:
   - `/src/plugins/external/auth.ts` - Implement automatic admin assignment for first 10 users
   - `/src/plugins/app/users/users-repository.ts` - Add search, filtering, bulk operations
   
2. **New Endpoints**:
   - `PATCH /api/users/bulk/roles` - Bulk role assignment
   - `PATCH /api/users/bulk/status` - Bulk status changes
   - `GET /api/users/search` - Enhanced search with filters

3. **Database Migrations**:
   - Add user status column if not exists
   - Create audit log table for user management actions
   - Add indexes for search performance

### Shared Contracts Impact
1. **New Schemas**:
   - `BulkUserUpdateRequestSchema` - For bulk operations
   - `UserSearchQuerySchema` - For enhanced search parameters
   - `UserAuditLogSchema` - For audit trail

2. **Enhanced Schemas**:
   - Update `ListUsersResponseSchema` to include status and search metadata
   - Extend `UpdateUserRequestSchema` with bulk operation support

## Risk Factors and Technical Unknowns

### High Risk Items
1. **Admin Bootstrap Logic**: Determining "first 10 users" logic needs clarification
   - Should this be based on creation order or specific criteria?
   - What happens if admins are deleted and we're back under 10 users?
   - Need safeguards to prevent admin lockout scenarios

2. **Azure AD Integration**: Current implementation uses base64 decoded tokens for testing
   - Production requires proper Azure AD token validation
   - Need to handle token expiration and refresh scenarios
   - Azure AD group mapping to internal roles may be needed

3. **Data Migration**: Existing users may need role assignments
   - Current database may have users without roles
   - Migration strategy needed for existing users

### Medium Risk Items  
1. **Bulk Operation Performance**: Large user bases may cause timeouts
   - Need efficient bulk update strategies
   - Consider background job processing for large operations

2. **Concurrent Modifications**: Multiple admins editing same user simultaneously
   - Need optimistic locking or conflict resolution strategy
   - UI should handle concurrent modification gracefully

3. **Role Hierarchy**: Current system has flat roles but may need hierarchy
   - Admin should inherit all permissions of lower roles
   - Complex permission calculations may impact performance

### Technical Unknowns
1. **Azure AD Configuration**: Production Azure AD setup requirements unclear
2. **User Provisioning**: Whether users should be pre-provisioned or created on-demand
3. **Audit Requirements**: Specific compliance requirements for user management actions
4. **Integration Points**: Whether external systems need user management notifications

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Clarify Admin Bootstrap Logic**: Define exact criteria for automatic admin assignment
2. **Azure AD Production Config**: Determine production Azure AD validation requirements  
3. **Design User Status Model**: Define what "active/inactive" means for business logic

### Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Basic user creation and automatic admin assignment
2. **Phase 2**: User management UI with basic role assignment
3. **Phase 3**: Bulk operations and advanced filtering
4. **Phase 4**: Audit logging and compliance features

## Domain Complexity Assessment

**Complexity Level: MEDIUM-HIGH**

This feature involves:
- Authentication and authorization flows (high complexity)
- Multi-tenant role-based access control (high complexity)  
- User interface for administrative functions (medium complexity)
- Database schema modifications and migrations (medium complexity)
- Integration between frontend auth and backend user management (high complexity)

**Recommendation**: Auth specialist should be involved for the authentication integration aspects, particularly around Azure AD token validation, JWT generation, and the admin bootstrap logic. The RBAC and user management UI components can be handled by full-stack developers with auth specialist consultation.
