## Release Context

All API requests can specify a release context using the `X-CMS-Release` header:

```http
GET /api/translations
X-CMS-Release: 12345
```

This header:
- Filters all content to show only what's visible in that release
- Defaults to the latest deployed release if not specified
- Must reference a release the user has permission to access
